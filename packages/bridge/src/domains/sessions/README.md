# Sessions

The core domain of the bridge server. Sessions manages the lifecycle of Claude Code agent processes — spawning, pooling, prompting, killing, and observing print-mode sessions. All sessions run via `claude --print` (PTY mode was removed in PRD 028). The domain also owns channel infrastructure for agent-to-agent visibility, scope enforcement via git hooks, transcript reading from JSONL session logs, and automatic retrospective generation on session termination.

## Domain Invariants

These invariants must hold across all session operations. Violations are bugs.

### I-1: Transcript fidelity

After a page refresh, the user sees the exact same prompt/response pairs they saw before refreshing. The transcript API returns collapsed `(user_prompt, final_assistant_response)` pairs — intermediate tool-use rounds (tool_use, tool_result) are internal and never surfaced to the consumer.

### I-2: Transcript identity

Each bridge session's transcript is resolved by matching the session ID to the JSONL filename (`{session_id}.jsonl`). The bridge session ID is passed to the Claude CLI as `--session-id`, which names the JSONL file. Time-proximity heuristics exist only as fallback for legacy sessions.

### I-3: Turn completeness

A completed prompt/response cycle shows the agent's final text response, never an intermediate tool-use step. If the agent used 15 tools before answering, the transcript shows only the question and the answer.

### I-4: Append-only transcript consistency

The JSONL transcript is append-only — turns are never modified or reordered. New turns appear at the end. `useTranscript` uses `staleTime: Infinity` because historical turns never change.

### I-5: Prompt metadata in-place

`pool.prompt()` reads `session.printMetadata` synchronously after `sendPrompt()` resolves — same tick, no separate getter, no race condition. The metadata travels with the response from backend to frontend without a second request.

### I-6: Event-driven list updates

Session list updates are signal-driven via BridgeEvents (`session.prompt.completed`, `session.spawned`, etc.) triggering `invalidateQueries`. The frontend never manually patches the session list — React Query owns the cache, events are just invalidation signals.

### I-7: Pool is the single owner

All session state flows through `SessionPool`. No route handler, event sink, or external consumer mutates session state directly. The pool enforces spawn limits, stale detection, budget constraints, and kill semantics.

### I-8: Restored sessions are inert

`pool.restoreSession()` hydrates internal Maps from a `SessionSnapshot` without spawning a process. The restored session is a minimal stub that lazy-upgrades to a real print session on first `sendPrompt()` (with `recovered: true` to trigger `--resume`). Restored sessions do not increment `totalSpawned`.

### I-9: Agent hoisted to session scope

`createAgent()` is called exactly once per `createPrintSession()` closure — at session scope, not inside `sendPrompt()`. This ensures `agent.state` accumulates cost, turns, and tokens across all invocations. The architecture gate `I-9` in `architecture.test.ts` enforces this structurally.

## CognitiveSink — Event Plumbing

`CognitiveSink` is the bridge between the `@method/pacta` cognitive algebra and the Universal Event Bus (PRD 026). It maps all 9 typed `CognitiveEvent` variants to `BridgeEvent` objects and emits them on the injected `EventBus` port.

### Role in the event pipeline

```
cognitive-provider.ts
  ├── onEvent(StreamEvent)       — SSE streaming for the frontend (unchanged)
  └── cognitiveSink.handle(CognitiveEvent)
        └── CognitiveSink.handle()
              └── bus.emit(BridgeEvent)   → all registered EventSinks
                    ├── WebSocketSink     — real-time frontend push
                    ├── PersistenceSink   — JSONL event log
                    └── GenesisSink       — batch summaries to Genesis agent
```

The `CognitiveSink` is constructed with an `EventBus` and an optional context object (`sessionId`, `projectId`, `experimentId`, `runId`). Context is forwarded to every emitted `BridgeEvent`. Call `setContext()` to update context mid-session (e.g. when a run ID is assigned after construction).

The composition root (`server-entry.ts`) is responsible for constructing the sink and passing it into `createCognitiveSession()` via the `cognitiveSink` option.

### Severity mapping

| CognitiveEvent type | BridgeEvent type | Severity |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| `cognitive:module_step` | `cognitive.module_step` | info |
| `cognitive:monitoring_signal` | `cognitive.monitoring_signal` | info |
| `cognitive:control_directive` | `cognitive.control_directive` | info |
| `cognitive:workspace_write` | `cognitive.workspace_write` | info |
| `cognitive:cycle_phase` | `cognitive.cycle_phase` | info |
| `cognitive:control_policy_violation` | `cognitive.control_policy_violation` | warning |
| `cognitive:workspace_eviction` | `cognitive.workspace_eviction` | warning |
| `cognitive:learn_failed` | `cognitive.learn_failed` | warning |
| `cognitive:cycle_aborted` | `cognitive.cycle_aborted` | error |

### BridgeEvent shape

Every event emitted by `CognitiveSink` has:
- `domain = 'cognitive'`
- `type = 'cognitive.{variant}'` (colon in algebra type replaced with dot for bridge convention)
- `payload` — the full `CognitiveEvent` data plus optional `experimentId`, `runId`, and top-level `cycleNumber` (surfaced from events that carry it)
- `source = 'bridge/sessions/cognitive-sink'`
- `sessionId`, `projectId` — forwarded from context when set
